                <p>Since I launched Find My Plane in February 2021, it has recorded over <b>100 million</b> datapoints for tens of thousands of flights. This is awesome, and I'm delighted that people find the tool useful! üòç</p>
                <p>I built FMP without a plan to monetise it: I know that Flight Simming is an expensive hobby and I just wanted to create something cool which would fill a need for me and others. This won't change. As long as it's around, Find My Plane will be free and open source.</p>
                <p>FMP is not expensive to run, but it's not entirely free either: <b>my server hosting costs run to around $15 a month</b>. If you feel you are able to contribute a dollar or two towards covering these running costs then please consider donating.</p>

                <p>If you don't feel you're able to contribute then that's also totally cool: please enjoy the tool as my gift to you!</p>
                <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
